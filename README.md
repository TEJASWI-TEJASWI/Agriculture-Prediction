# Agriculture-Prediction
1 Abstract

In India, agriculture is considered to be the largest economic sector as per population. It plays a vital role in the development of the nation and contributing to its economy.
Various crops are grown here including staples such as rice and wheat among the most important ones. Other food crops that grow here include pulses, potatoes and other vegetables.
Cash crops such as sugarcane, oil-seeds, cotton, coffee, tea, rubber, and jute are also grown here. Despite the fact that agriculture is a part of such a major portion of the 
Indian economy and employs a large section of society, it is highly inefficient, unscientific, and incapable of meeting the high food demands in such a hugely populated country.
Despite advancements in this area, these problems still persist in most of the areas. These problems can be solved by proper analysis of the agricultural scenario and extracting 
information to provide suggestions regarding effective ways of growing crops and making choices in the type of crops.

2 Introduction
In agriculture sector, the farmers and agro based industries have to take several decisions every day and there are various factors that influence them. Some of the factors on 
which agriculture depends are soil, climate, cultivation, irrigation, fertilizers, temperature, rainfall, harvesting and use of pesticides. Mining the large amount of existing 
crop, soil and climatic data and analyzing the environmental conditions can make it possible for farmers to use this information and get help to make critical farming decisions. 
This optimizes the production and makes agriculture more resilient to climatic change. Historical crop yield information is also important for supply chain operation of companies 
engaged in industries. These industries use agricultural products as raw material, livestock, food, animal feed, chemical, poultry, fertilizer, pesticides, seed and paper. 
An accurate estimate of crop production and risk helps these companies in planning supply chain decision like production scheduling. Business such as seed, fertilizer, 
agrochemical and agricultural machinery industries plan production and marketing activities based on crop production estimates.

2.1 Objectives(Problem Statement):
This project uses several machine learning techniques to extract information from agriculture data and to give suggestions regarding crops and make future predictions so that 
agriculture can be carried out in a planned manner. The objectives of the project include-
1. Finding trends in crops in terms of production, area, etc. over the years and studying the reasons behind the changing trends.
2. Finding how different factors that affect production are related to each other.
3. Prediction of suicide rate of the farmers.
4. Study of crops that do not follow the general trends and show an abnormal trend such as reduction in production.
5. Finding similar crops and similar states based on various factors.
6. Predictions of crops that might be rarely produced and the main crops that might be preferred by the farmers.
